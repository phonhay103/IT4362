Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,100000 years ago at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods nations and human rights; to trust money books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology anthropology paleontology and economics he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies the animals and plants around us and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors And what if anything can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come Bold wide-ranging and provocative Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human our thoughts our actions our power and our future,845616,4.38
Educated,Tara Westover,Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her  head-for-the-hills bag . In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother a midwife and healer and in the winter she salvaged in her father s junkyard. Her father forbade hospitals so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions even burns from explosions were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara s older brothers became violent. Then lacking any formal education Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University where she studied history learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her taking her over oceans and across continents to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she d traveled too far if there was still a way home. Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one s life through new eyes and the will to change it,1252624,4.47

Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,Yuval Noah Harari,Yuval Noah Harari author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens returns with an equally original compelling and provocative book turning his focus toward humanity s future and our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine plague and war. This may seem hard to accept but as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough yet riveting—famine plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine plague and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth what destinies will we set ourselves and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller Harari maps out our future,218149,4.22
The Meaning of Marriage: Facing the Complexities of Commitment with the Wisdom of God,Timothy J. Keller,Renowned pastor of New York’s Redeemer Presbyterian Church and author of The Songs of Jesus Timothy Keller with his wife of 36 years delivers The Meaning of Marriage an extraordinarily insightful look at the keys to happiness in marriage that will inspire Christians skeptics singles long-time married couples and those about to be engaged. Modern culture would make you believe that everyone has a soul-mate; that romance is the most important part of a successful marriage; that your spouse is there to help you realize your potential; that marriage does not mean forever but merely for now; that starting over after a divorce is the best solution to seemingly intractable marriage issues. All those modern-day assumptions are in a word wrong. Using the Bible as his guide coupled with insightful commentary from his wife of thirty-six years Kathy Timothy Keller shows that God created marriage to bring us closer to him and to bring us more joy in our lives. It is a glorious relationship that is also the most misunderstood and mysterious. With a clear-eyed understanding of the Bible and meaningful instruction on how to have a successful marriage The Meaning of Marriage is essential reading for anyone who wants to know God and love more deeply in this life,31055,4.47

City of Blades,Robert Jackson Bennett,A generation ago the city of Voortyashtan was the stronghold of the god of war and death the birthplace of fearsome supernatural sentinels who killed and subjugated millions. Now the city’s god is dead. The city itself lies in ruins. And to its new military occupiers the once-powerful capital is a wasteland of sectarian violence and bloody uprisings.

Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason Science Humanism and Progress,Steven Pinker,Is modernity really failing? Or have we failed to appreciate progress and the ideals that make it possible? If you follow the headlines the world in the 21st century appears to be sinking into chaos hatred and irrationality. Yet Steven Pinker shows that this is an illusion - a symptom of historical amnesia and statistical fallacies. If you follow the trendlines rather than the headlines you discover that our lives have become longer healthier safer happier more peaceful more stimulating and more prosperous - not just in the West but worldwide. Such progress is no accident: it s the gift of a coherent and inspiring value system that many of us embrace without even realizing it. These are the values of the Enlightenment: of reason science humanism and progress. The challenges we face today are formidable including inequality climate change Artificial Intelligence and nuclear weapons. But the way to deal with them is not to sink into despair or try to lurch back to a mythical idyllic past; it s to treat them as problems we can solve as we have solved other problems in the past. In making the case for an Enlightenment newly recharged for the 21st century Pinker shows how we can use our faculties of reason and sympathy to solve the problems that inevitably come with being products of evolution in an indifferent universe. We will never have a perfect world but - defying the chorus of fatalism and reaction - we can continue to make it a better one,27295,4.21

The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,Carl Sagan,How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.

And yet disturbingly in today’s so-called information age pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction channeling past lives and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect.

The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company,Robert Iger,A grand vision defined: The CEO of The Walt Disney Company shares the ideas and values he has used to reinvent one of the most beloved companies in the world and inspire the people who bring the magic to life. In 2005 Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company during a difficult time. Morale had deteriorated competition was more intense and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company s history.  I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past  Iger writes.  The only thing that mattered was the future and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go.  It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets. Twelve years later Disney is the largest most respected media company in the world counting Pixar Marvel Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time. Now he s sharing the lessons he s learned while running Disney and leading its 200000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It s also about thoughtfulness and respect and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving Star Wars myth.  Over the past fourteen years I think I ve learned so much about what real leadership is  Iger writes.  But I couldn t have articulated all of this until I lived it. You can t fake it--and that s one of the key lessons in this book ,66222,4.42

Taking us into a landscape most of us have never before seen award-winning journalist Barbara Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive totalitarian regime today—an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet in which radio and television dials are welded to the one government station and where displays of affection are punished; a police state where informants are rewarded and where an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. Demick takes us deep inside the country beyond the reach of government censors. Through meticulous and sensitive reporting we see her six subjects—average North Korean citizens—fall in love raise families nurture ambitions and struggle for survival. One by one we experience the moments when they realize that their government has betrayed them.

His  wonderful awful  idea is to don a Santa outfit strap heavy antlers on his poor quivering dog Max construct a makeshift sleigh head down to Whoville and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all. Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents their food even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It s not sobbing but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos the transcendent nature of joy and of course the growth potential of a heart that s two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos,385123,4.37

Othello,William Shakespeare,In Othello Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona) with elopement and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello s African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race of age of cultural background—that one should not perhaps be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello s standard-bearer Iago who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago s insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago s schemes; of an innocent Desdemona who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults the outcome of Othello s mistaken convictions about her faithlessness,360850,3.9
A Brief History of Time,Stephen Hawking,In the ten years since its publication in 1988 Stephen Hawking s classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking s theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE) which probed back in time to within 300000 years of the universe s beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations as well as his own recent research Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel and updated the chapters throughout,391604,4.2
The Crucible,Arthur Miller, I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history  Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events Miller s drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town s most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence. Written in 1953 The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy s  witch-hunts  in the United States. Within the text itself Miller contemplates the parallels writing  Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence. ,377132,3.6
Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can t Stop Talking,Susan Cain,At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks Chopin Dr. Seuss Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued superbly researched and filled with indelible stories of real people Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and equally important how they see themselves.
