Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,100000 years ago at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods nations and human rights; to trust money books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology anthropology paleontology and economics he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies the animals and plants around us and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors And what if anything can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come Bold wide-ranging and provocative Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human our thoughts our actions our power and our future,845616,4.38
Educated,Tara Westover,Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her  head-for-the-hills bag . In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother a midwife and healer and in the winter she salvaged in her father s junkyard. Her father forbade hospitals so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions even burns from explosions were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara s older brothers became violent. Then lacking any formal education Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University where she studied history learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her taking her over oceans and across continents to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she d traveled too far if there was still a way home. Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one s life through new eyes and the will to change it,1252624,4.47

Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,Yuval Noah Harari,Yuval Noah Harari author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens returns with an equally original compelling and provocative book turning his focus toward humanity s future and our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine plague and war. This may seem hard to accept but as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough yet riveting—famine plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine plague and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth what destinies will we set ourselves and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller Harari maps out our future,218149,4.22
The Meaning of Marriage: Facing the Complexities of Commitment with the Wisdom of God,Timothy J. Keller,Renowned pastor of New York’s Redeemer Presbyterian Church and author of The Songs of Jesus Timothy Keller with his wife of 36 years delivers The Meaning of Marriage an extraordinarily insightful look at the keys to happiness in marriage that will inspire Christians skeptics singles long-time married couples and those about to be engaged. Modern culture would make you believe that everyone has a soul-mate; that romance is the most important part of a successful marriage; that your spouse is there to help you realize your potential; that marriage does not mean forever but merely for now; that starting over after a divorce is the best solution to seemingly intractable marriage issues. All those modern-day assumptions are in a word wrong. Using the Bible as his guide coupled with insightful commentary from his wife of thirty-six years Kathy Timothy Keller shows that God created marriage to bring us closer to him and to bring us more joy in our lives. It is a glorious relationship that is also the most misunderstood and mysterious. With a clear-eyed understanding of the Bible and meaningful instruction on how to have a successful marriage The Meaning of Marriage is essential reading for anyone who wants to know God and love more deeply in this life,31055,4.47

City of Blades,Robert Jackson Bennett,A generation ago the city of Voortyashtan was the stronghold of the god of war and death the birthplace of fearsome supernatural sentinels who killed and subjugated millions. Now the city’s god is dead. The city itself lies in ruins. And to its new military occupiers the once-powerful capital is a wasteland of sectarian violence and bloody uprisings.

Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason Science Humanism and Progress,Steven Pinker,Is modernity really failing? Or have we failed to appreciate progress and the ideals that make it possible? If you follow the headlines the world in the 21st century appears to be sinking into chaos hatred and irrationality. Yet Steven Pinker shows that this is an illusion - a symptom of historical amnesia and statistical fallacies. If you follow the trendlines rather than the headlines you discover that our lives have become longer healthier safer happier more peaceful more stimulating and more prosperous - not just in the West but worldwide. Such progress is no accident: it s the gift of a coherent and inspiring value system that many of us embrace without even realizing it. These are the values of the Enlightenment: of reason science humanism and progress. The challenges we face today are formidable including inequality climate change Artificial Intelligence and nuclear weapons. But the way to deal with them is not to sink into despair or try to lurch back to a mythical idyllic past; it s to treat them as problems we can solve as we have solved other problems in the past. In making the case for an Enlightenment newly recharged for the 21st century Pinker shows how we can use our faculties of reason and sympathy to solve the problems that inevitably come with being products of evolution in an indifferent universe. We will never have a perfect world but - defying the chorus of fatalism and reaction - we can continue to make it a better one,27295,4.21

The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,Carl Sagan,How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.

And yet disturbingly in today’s so-called information age pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction channeling past lives and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect.

The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company,Robert Iger,A grand vision defined: The CEO of The Walt Disney Company shares the ideas and values he has used to reinvent one of the most beloved companies in the world and inspire the people who bring the magic to life. In 2005 Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company during a difficult time. Morale had deteriorated competition was more intense and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company s history.  I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past  Iger writes.  The only thing that mattered was the future and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go.  It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets. Twelve years later Disney is the largest most respected media company in the world counting Pixar Marvel Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time. Now he s sharing the lessons he s learned while running Disney and leading its 200000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It s also about thoughtfulness and respect and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving Star Wars myth.  Over the past fourteen years I think I ve learned so much about what real leadership is  Iger writes.  But I couldn t have articulated all of this until I lived it. You can t fake it--and that s one of the key lessons in this book ,66222,4.42

Taking us into a landscape most of us have never before seen award-winning journalist Barbara Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive totalitarian regime today—an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet in which radio and television dials are welded to the one government station and where displays of affection are punished; a police state where informants are rewarded and where an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. Demick takes us deep inside the country beyond the reach of government censors. Through meticulous and sensitive reporting we see her six subjects—average North Korean citizens—fall in love raise families nurture ambitions and struggle for survival. One by one we experience the moments when they realize that their government has betrayed them.

His  wonderful awful  idea is to don a Santa outfit strap heavy antlers on his poor quivering dog Max construct a makeshift sleigh head down to Whoville and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all. Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents their food even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It s not sobbing but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos the transcendent nature of joy and of course the growth potential of a heart that s two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos,385123,4.37

The next day America learns that two of its Supreme Court justices have been assassinated. And in New Orleans a young law student prepares a legal brief...

Othello,William Shakespeare,In Othello Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona) with elopement and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello s African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race of age of cultural background—that one should not perhaps be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello s standard-bearer Iago who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago s insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago s schemes; of an innocent Desdemona who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults the outcome of Othello s mistaken convictions about her faithlessness,360850,3.9
A Brief History of Time,Stephen Hawking,In the ten years since its publication in 1988 Stephen Hawking s classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking s theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE) which probed back in time to within 300000 years of the universe s beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations as well as his own recent research Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel and updated the chapters throughout,391604,4.2
The Crucible,Arthur Miller, I believe that the reader will discover here the essential nature of one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history  Arthur Miller wrote of his classic play about the witch-hunts and trials in seventeenth-century Salem Massachusetts. Based on historical people and real events Miller s drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town s most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence. Written in 1953 The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy s  witch-hunts  in the United States. Within the text itself Miller contemplates the parallels writing  Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence. ,377132,3.6
Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can t Stop Talking,Susan Cain,At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks Chopin Dr. Seuss Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued superbly researched and filled with indelible stories of real people Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and equally important how they see themselves.

Twilight,Stephenie Meyer,About three things I was absolutely positive. First  Edward was a vampire.

Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty,Abhijit V. Banerjee,Billions of government dollars and thousands of charitable organizations and NGOs are dedicated to helping the world's poor. But much of their work is based on assumptions that are untested generalizations at best harmful misperceptions at worst. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have pioneered the use of randomized control trials in development economics. Work based on these principles supervised by the Poverty Action Lab is being carried out in dozens of countries. Drawing on this and their 15 years of research from Chile to India Kenya to Indonesia they have identified wholly new aspects of the behavior of poor people their needs and the way that aid or financial investment can affect their lives. Their work defies certain presumptions: that microfinance is a cure-all that schooling equals learning that poverty at the level of 99 cents a day is just a more extreme version of the experience any of us have when our income falls uncomfortably low. This important book illuminates how the poor live and offers all of us an opportunity to think of a world beyond poverty,19689,4.28
Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power Prosperity and Poverty,James A. Robinson,Is it culture the weather geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? Simply no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world while other African nations such as Zimbabwe the Congo and Sierra Leone are mired in poverty and violence? Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea to take just one of their fascinating examples is a remarkably homogeneous nation yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives rewarded innovation and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly the people of the north have endured decades of famine political repression and very different economic institutions—with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire the Mayan city-states medieval Venice the Soviet Union Latin America England Europe the United States and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today including: - China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West? - Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority? - What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions? Why Nations Fail will change the way you look at—and understand—the world,44135,4.08
Development as Freedom,Amartya Sen,By the winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics an essential and paradigm-altering framework for understanding economic development—for both rich and poor—in the twenty-first century. Freedom Sen argues is both the end and most efficient means of sustaining economic life and the key to securing the general welfare of the world's entire population. Releasing the idea of individual freedom from association with any particular historical intellectual political or religious tradition Sen clearly demonstrates its current applicability and possibilities. In the new global economy where despite unprecedented increases in overall opulence the contemporary world denies elementary freedoms to vast numbers—perhaps even the majority of people—he concludes it is still possible to practically and optimistically regain a sense of social accountability. Development as Freedom is essential reading.,6520,4.1
The End of Poverty,Malcolm Hilgartner,Hailed by Time as one of the world's hundred most influential people Jeffrey D. Sachs is renowned for his work around the globe advising economies in crisis. Now a classic of its genre The End of Poverty distills more than thirty years of experience to offer a uniquely informed vision of the steps that can transform impoverished countries into prosperous ones.

Explaining his own work in Bolivia Russia India China and Africa he offers an integrated set of solutions to the interwoven economic political environmental and social problems that challenge the world's poorest countries.

The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It,Paul Collier,In the universally acclaimed and award-winning The Bottom Billion Paul Collier reveals that fifty failed states--home to the poorest one billion people on Earth--pose the central challenge of the developing world in the twenty-first century. The book shines much-needed light on this group of small nations largely unnoticed by the industrialized West that are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nations between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure pointing to a set of traps that ensnare these countries including civil war a dependence on the extraction and export of natural resources and bad governance. Standard solutions do not work he writes; aid is often ineffective and globalization can actually make matters worse driving development to more stable nations. What the bottom billion need Collier argues is a bold new plan supported by the Group of Eight industrialized nations. If failed states are ever to be helped the G8 will have to adopt preferential trade policies new laws against corruption new international charters and even conduct carefully calibrated military interventions. Collier has spent a lifetime working to end global poverty. In The Bottom Billion he offers real hope for solving one of the great humanitarian crises facing the world today,7423,3.86
Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa,Dambisa Moyo,In the past fifty years more than $1 trillion in development-related aid has been transferred from rich countries to Africa. Has this assistance improved the lives of Africans? No. In fact across the continent the recipients of this aid are not better off as a result of it but worse—much worse. In Dead Aid Dambisa Moyo describes the state of postwar development policy in Africa today and unflinchingly confronts one of the greatest myths of our time: that billions of dollars in aid sent from wealthy countries to developing African nations has helped to reduce poverty and increase growth. In fact poverty levels continue to escalate and growth rates have steadily declined—and millions continue to suffer. Provocatively drawing a sharp contrast between African countries that have rejected the aid route and prospered and others that have become aid-dependent and seen poverty increase Moyo illuminates the way in which overreliance on aid has trapped developing nations in a vicious circle of aid dependency corruption market distortion and further poverty leaving them with nothing but the “need” for more aid. Debunking the current model of international aid promoted by both Hollywood celebrities and policy makers Moyo offers a bold new road map for financing development of the world’s poorest countries that guarantees economic growth and a significant decline in poverty—without reliance on foreign aid or aid-related assistance. Dead Aid is an unsettling yet optimistic work a powerful challenge to the assumptions and arguments that support a profoundly misguided development policy in Africa. And it is a clarion call to a new more hopeful vision of how to address the desperate poverty that plagues millions,7299,3.7
The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good,William Easterly,From one of the world's best-known development economists--an excoriating attack on the tragic hubris of the West's efforts to improve the lot of the so-called developing world. Brilliant at diagnosing the failings of Western intervention in the Third World. --BusinessWeek In his previous book The Elusive Quest for Growth William Easterly criticized the utter ineffectiveness of Western organizations to mitigate global poverty and he was promptly fired by his then-employer the World Bank. The White Man's Burden is his widely anticipated counterpunch--a brilliant and blistering indictment of the West's economic policies for the world's poor. Sometimes angry sometimes irreverent but always clear-eyed and rigorous Easterly argues that we in the West need to face our own history of ineptitude and draw the proper conclusions especially at a time when the question of our ability to transplant Western institutions has become one of the most pressing issues we face,5402,3.84
The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty,Nina Munk,A powerful portrayal of Jeffrey Sachs's ambitious quest to end global poverty "The poor you will always have with you" to cite the Gospel of Matthew 26:11. Jeffrey Sachs—celebrated economist special advisor to the Secretary General of the United Nations and author of the influential bestseller The End of Poverty—disagrees.  In his view poverty is a problem that can be solved. With single-minded determination he has attempted to put into practice his theories about ending extreme poverty to prove that the world's most destitute people can be lifted onto "the ladder of development." In 2006 Sachs launched the Millennium Villages Project a daring five-year experiment designed to test his theories in Africa. The first Millennium village was in Sauri a remote cluster of farming communities in western Kenya. The initial results were encouraging. With his first taste of success and backed by one hundred twenty million dollars from George Soros and other likeminded donors Sachs rolled out a dozen model villages in ten sub-Saharan countries. Once his approach was validated it would be scaled up across the entire continent. At least that was the idea. For the past six years Nina Munk has reported deeply on the Millennium Villages Project accompanying Sachs on his official trips to Africa and listening in on conversations with heads-of-state humanitarian organizations rival economists and development experts. She has immersed herself in the lives of people in two Millennium villages: Ruhiira in southwest Uganda and Dertu in the arid borderland between Kenya and Somalia. Accepting the hospitality of camel herders and small-hold farmers and witnessing their struggle to survive Munk came to understand the real-life issues that challenge Sachs's formula for ending global poverty. The Idealist is the profound and moving story of what happens when the abstract theories of a brilliant driven man meet the reality of human life,1320,3.94

Cinderella Ate My Daughter: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the New Girlie-Girl Culture,Peggy Orenstein,Sweet and sassy or predatory and hardened sexualized girlhood influences our daughters from infancy onward telling them that how a girl looks matters more than who she is. Somewhere between the exhilarating rise of Girl Power in the 1990s and today the pursuit of physical perfection has been recast as the source of female empowerment. And commercialization has spread the message faster and farther reaching girls at ever-younger ages. But how dangerous is pink and pretty anyway? Being a princess is just make-believe; eventually they grow out of it . . . or do they? In search of answers Peggy Orenstein visited Disneyland trolled American Girl Place and met parents of beauty-pageant preschoolers tricked out like Vegas showgirls. The stakes turn out to be higher than she ever imagined. From premature sexualization to the risk of depression to rising rates of narcissism the potential negative impact of this new girlie-girl culture is undeniable—yet armed with awareness and recognition parents can effectively counterbalance its influence in their daughters' lives.,15961,3.67
Vision to Reality: Stop Working Start Living,Curtis L. Jenkins,Entrepreneurs who are facing challenges with growing their businesses often face the same issues that impede their growth. Many entrepreneurs believe that to grow their businesses they must work harder and harder. They overlook the importance of the team the financials and a solid plan that must be executed and adjusted on a daily weekly and monthly basis. They don’t understand the concept of working “on the business” because they are too often working – harder and harder – “in the business” creating another job for themselves instead of rising to leadership and orchestrating a well-run business. Vision to Reality provides a simple set of steps to help entrepreneurs realize their vision for their business and “clear the fog” for everyone involved to get on board with executing the vision. The goal of Vision to Reality is to help entrepreneurs clear the fog for themselves and their business giving them confidence that they can tackle problems head-on despite the problems appearing insurmountable. It is unique and appealing because it introduces a new opportunity using simple but effective foundational principles and tools often overlooked by entrepreneurs in their quest for business success,5640,4.31
Scaling Up Excellence: Getting to More Without Settling for Less,Hayagreeva Rao,In Scaling Up Excellence bestselling author Robert Sutton and Stanford colleague Huggy Rao tackle a challenge that determines every organization’s success: scaling up farther faster and more effectively as a program or an organization creates a larger footprint. Sutton and Rao have devoted much of the last decade to uncovering what it takes to build and uncover pockets of exemplary performance to help spread them and to keep recharging organizations with ever better work practices. Drawing on inside accounts and case studies and academic research from a wealth of industries – including start-ups pharmaceuticals airlines retail financial services high-tech education non-profits government and healthcare -- Sutton and Rao identify the key scaling challenges that confront every organization. They tackle the difficult trade-offs that organizations must make between “Buddhism” versus “Catholicism” -- whether to encourage individualized approaches tailored to local needs or to replicate the same practices and customs as an organization or program expands. They reveal how the best leaders and teams develop spread and instill the right mindsets in their people -- rather than ruining or watering down the very things that have fueled successful growth in the past. They unpack the principles that help to cascade excellence throughout an organization as well as show how to eliminate destructive beliefs and behaviors that will hold them back. Scaling Up Excellence is the first major business book devoted to this universal and vexing challenge. It is destined to become the standard bearer in the field,2044,3.75

Zero to One: Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future,Peter Thiel,If you want to build a better future you must believe in secrets. The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself. Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places,304341,4.18
The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,Eric Ries,Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing it relies on "validated learning" rapid scientific experimentation as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility altering plans inch by inch minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever,297033,4.11

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,Jim Collins,When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life. But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now I am not saying that by using Covey’s model or anyone else’s model for that matter you can become a sure-shot success but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So where is the shortcoming? There are two main problems here and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them. The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are they can rattle them off end to end but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book yes and a lot of people have just failed to see through them. That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book or rather his model was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life. But before we barge into that area it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life,673496,4.15
Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action,Simon Sinek,Why are some people and organizations more innovative more influential and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr. Steve Jobs and the Wright Brothers might have little in common but they all started with why. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things. In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world Simon Sinek discovered that they all think act and communicate in the exact same way—and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built movements can be lead and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY. Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. WHY is not money or profit—those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders but not others? Starting with WHY works in big business and small business in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to. Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire. This book is for anyone who wants to inspire others or who wants to find someone to inspire them,187184,4.1
Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,James C. Collins,To find the keys to greatness Collins's 21-person research team read and coded 6000 articles generated more than 2000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project. The findings will surprise many readers and quite frankly upset others. The Challenge Built to Last the defining management study of the nineties showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies mediocre companies even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies including Coca-Cola Intel General Electric and Merck. The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include: Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap,172528,4.13

Growing a Business,Paul Hawken,Paul Hawken demonstrates that the answers to small business problems today cannot be solved by college degrees training or money—but only by you. Nearly everyone harbors a secret dream of starting or owning a business. In fact a million businesses start in the United States every year. Many of them fail but enough succeed so that small businesses are now adding millions of jobs to the economy at the same time that the Fortune 500 companies are actually losing jobs. Paul Hawken—entrepreneur and bestselling author—wrote Growing a Business for those who set out to make their dream a reality. He knows what he's talking about; he is his own best example of success. In the early 1970s while he was still in his twenties he founded Erewhon the largest distributor of natural foods. More recently he founded and still runs Smith & Hawken the premier mail-order garden tool company. And he wrote a critically acclaimed book called The Next Economy about the future of the economy. Using examples like Patagonia Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Ice Cream and University National Bank of Palo Alto California Hawken shows that the successful business is an expression of an individual person. The most successful business your idea for a business will grow from something that is deep within you something that can't be stolen by anyone because it is so uniquely yours that anyone else who tried to execute your idea would fail. He dispels the myth of the risk-taking entrepreneur. The purpose of business he points out is not to take risks but rather to get something done,1432,4.16
